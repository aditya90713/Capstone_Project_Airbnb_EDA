# Capstone_Project_Airbnb_EDA
Almabetter EDA Project

Airbnb, an influential online marketplace that facilitates connections between property hosts and prospective tenants, spans across more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries globally. Our current focus lies in the vibrant context of New York City (NYC) in 2019, a year when the city attracted an impressive 66.6 million visitors. Within this project, our primary objective centers on the thorough analysis of Airbnb's dataset for NYC, recognizing the pivotal role data plays in the company's operations. The overarching goal is to uncover the key metrics that shape property listings on the platform. Through the application of fundamental exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, we meticulously scrutinize the distribution of listings based on various factors, such as location, pricing, room types, and more.

NYC, as the quintessential global destination, stands out not only for its cultural and commercial prominence but also as a top choice for Airbnb users. The intricacies of thousands of listings on the platform provide a rich dataset, which we dissect from multiple perspectives. Our analytical approach extends to unveiling insights into the distribution of listings according to location, price ranges, room types, and other relevant parameters. This comprehensive examination equips Airbnb's marketing, finance, and technical teams with actionable insights to inform their strategic decision-making processes.

In the dynamic landscape of the hospitality industry, Airbnb's success hinges on its ability to harness valuable insights from the vast array of data at its disposal. Through our exploration and visualization of the NYC dataset, we uncover compelling patterns and correlations that can guide strategic decisions. This robust data-driven analysis serves as a powerful tool for Airbnb's marketing team to refine their outreach strategies, the finance team to optimize pricing models, and the technical team to enhance the platform's functionality.

By delving into the nuanced details of Airbnb listings in NYC, we uncover compelling trends that have broader implications for the platform's success. The geographical distribution, pricing dynamics, and room type preferences revealed in our analysis offer nuanced insights for making informed decisions. This holistic understanding of the NYC dataset provides a solid foundation for Airbnb's teams to align their efforts and strategies effectively, ensuring a seamless experience for both hosts and guests on the platform.
